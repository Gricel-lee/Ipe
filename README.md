Some info about IPE drawing tool


## Add colours
There is a list of defined colours to be added into Ipe. In Mac, go to Applications>Ipe.app>Contents>Resources>styles>colors.isy and copy the file in a different location. Then, in the Ipe IDE, go to Edit>Style sheets, and add this file. Now all the new colours are available!

- Check a list of names assigned to colours here:

If you want to define your own, add it to the same file. 

FYI. The colour list is based on the KAPPA (Kernel Application Package)! http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/docs/sun95.htx/sun95se29.html
